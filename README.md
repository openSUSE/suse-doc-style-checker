# SUSE Documentation Style Checker

With its little mind tries very hard to check whether documentation is compliant with the
[SUSE Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/SUSE/doc-styleguide).

Releases are usually aligned with releases of the Style Guide.


## Usage

* To use SDSC from this Git repository, set up a
  [Python 3 Virtual Environment](https://github.com/openSUSE/suse-doc-style-checker/wiki/Initializing-Python3-Virtual-Environment)

* On openSUSE systems, you can install the RPM version of SDSC from
  [the Documentation:Tools project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Documentation:Tools)
